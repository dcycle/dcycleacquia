# Set up the environment to perform builds on Circle CI.
# We use Circle CI (https://circleci.com/gh/alberto56/dcycle-metrics) for
# continuous integration: every new push to GitHub triggers a "Build" on Circle
# CI. This file sets up the Circle CI environment with Docker and Docker
# compose, and then runs the ./test.sh script, specifying the location of
# environment variables needed by the Circle CI host.
